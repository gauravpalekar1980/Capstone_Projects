The most famous member of the genus is variola virus, which causes smallpox. Variola was eradicated using vaccinia virus as a vaccine. Cowpox is an infectious disease caused by the cowpox virus.

Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox and the observation that dairymaids were immune from smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.
